The mini Arcade Game enclosure and Smartie sorting functionality were designed in Fusion 360. 

The physical components used for this project were either laser cut or 3D printed.

The woodon components were laser cut from:

- 6 mm MDF

And the acrylic components were laser cut from either:

- 3 mm transparent acrylic
- or 6 mm transparent acrylic

The 3D printed components were printed using a Zortrax M300 3D printer. The components were printed using:

- White PLA filament

### 1.2. Fusion 360 project

The Fusion 360 project contains the following folder structure:

```
.
|__ Smartie Sorter 3000
    |__ Assemblies
    |__ Components
