# Design 

Information about the design of the Smartie Sorter 3000 is presented in this document. First, Section 1 provides more information about the name sign present at the top of the Smartie Sorter 3000's mini arcade game enclosure. Thereafter, section 2 provides more information about the Smartie Sorter 3000's colour scheme.

The Smartie Sorter 3000 logo and the colour schemes were created using Affinity Designer. The .afdesign files are available in the [affinity_designer](https://github.com/pieterberg/Smartie-Sorter/tree/main/documentation/design/affinity_designer) folder.

## 1. Name Sign

This section provides more information about the name sign present at the top of the Smartie Sorter 3000's mini arcade game enlcosure.

The "3000" in the Smartie Sorter 3000's name comes from the TCS3200 colour sensor that the Smartie Sorter 3000 uses to determine the Smartie and M&M colours.

The logo was stylized using the Bauhaus 93 typeface.

### 1.1. Digital File

The Smartie Sorter 3000 logo is presented in Figure 1. The logo has 8 slanted stripes that correspond to the 8 Smartie colours, which are presented in Section 2.3.

The [name sign](https://github.com/pieterberg/Smartie-Sorter/tree/main/documentation/design/name_sign) folder contains both a .png version and an .svg version of the Smartie Sorter 3000 logo.

### 1.2. Enclosure Placement

The Smartie Sorter 3000 logo was printed on a 270 mm x 55 mm vinyl sticker and affixed to the Name Sign component.

The Name Sign component is backlit using 12 V LED strips present in the top-section of the mini arcade game enclosure, as documented in [electronics.md](https://github.com/pieterberg/Smartie-Sorter/blob/main/electronics.md).

## 2. Colour Scheme

This section presents the colour schemes used to design the Smartie Sorter 3000. The colour schemes and hex codes of the mini arcade game enclosure, arcade game buttons, Smartie chocolates, and M&M chocolates are provided.

The [colour_scheme](https://github.com/pieterberg/Smartie-Sorter/tree/main/documentation/design/colour_scheme) folder contains .png versions of the colour schemes.

### 2.1. Enclosure Design

The colour scheme used for the design of the mini arcade game enclosure is presented by Figure 2. The outside surfaces of the mini arcade game enclosure are painted brown while the internal surfaces of the mini arcade game enclosure are painted white.

The brown colour used for the design of the mini arcade game enclosure is based on the Rust-Oleum Painter's Touch Ultra Cover satin Nutmeg paint.

## 3. Sorting Locations

Once sorted, the Smarties and M&M's are transferred to the acrylic Sorted Smarties Collector component. The sorted positions of the Smarties and M&M's are presented in this section.

### 3.1. Smartie Locations

The locations of the sorted Smarties in the Sorted Smarties Collector component are similar to their locations in the Smartie chocolates' colour scheme that was presented in Figure 4.
### 3.2. M&M Locations

The locations of the sorted M&M's in the Sorted Smarties Collector component are similar to their locations in the official M&M colour scheme that was presented in Figure 5. Since there are only 6 M&M colours, the final two locations in the Sorted Smarties Collector component are not used when sorting M&M's.
