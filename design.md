# Design 

The design aspects of the Smartie Sorter 3000 are presented here. First, Section 1 looks at the "Smartie Sorter 3000" logo and name sign used for the design. Then, Section 2 looks at the colour schemes used for the mini arcade-game enclosure, the arcade game buttons, and the Smartie chocolates and M&M chocolates. Finally, Section 3 looks at the sorting locations once the colours of the Smarties and M&M's have been determined.

All colour schemes were designed using Affinity Designer, and all renders were made using Fusion 360.

## 1. Name sign

The documentation for the "Smartie Sorter 3000" name sign used in this project is provided in this section.

### 1.1. Digital file

The "Smartie Sorter 3000" name sign placed at the top of the mini arcade-game enclosure is presented in Figure 1. The name sign has 8 slanted stripes corresponding to the 8 Smartie colours, presented in Section 2.3. The name "Smartie Sorter 3000" comes from the TCS3200 colour sensor that the Smartie Sorter uses to determine the Smartie and M&M colours.

The [name sign](https://github.com/pieterberg/Smartie-Sorter/tree/main/documentation/design/name_sign) folder contains both a .png version and an .svg version of the "Smartie Sorter 3000" name sign.

### 1.2. Enclosure placement

The "Smartie Sorter 3000" name sign was printed on a 270 mm x 55 mm vinyl sticker and placed at the top of the mini arcade game enclosure, on top of the 6 mm transparent acrylic Name Sign component. The name sign is backlit using the 12 V LED strips present in the top-section of the mini arcade game enclosure. The placement of the "Smartie Sorter 3000" name sign is shown in Figure 2.

## 2. Colour scheme

The colour schemes and hex codes used for the mini arcade game enclosure, arcade game buttons, Smartie chocolates, and M&M chocolates are provided in this section.

### 2.1. Enclosure design

The Smartie Sorter's mini arcade game enclosure has a brown and white colour scheme, and was painted using brown and white Rust-Oleum spray paint. The colour scheme used for the enclosure is presented in Figure 3.

The hex codes used for the enclosure's colour scheme are provided in Table 1.

Table 1: Hex codes for the enclosure's colour scheme

| Enclosure Colours |  Hex code |
|-------------------|:---------:|
| Brown             | `#8D6B3E` |
| White             | `#FFFFFF` |

### 2.2. Arcade-game buttons

The Smartie Sorter uses three Sanwa arcade game buttons to control the sorting process: one light-blue arcade game button to control the lighting, and two white arcade game buttons to control the start and stop of the colour sorting process. The colour scheme used to represent the Sanwa arcade game buttons is presented in Figure 4.

The hex codes used to represent the blue and white Sanwa arcade game buttons are provided in Table 2.

Table 2: Hex codes for the Sanwa arcade game buttons' colour scheme

| Arcade Button Colours |  Hex code |
|-----------------------|:---------:|
| Blue                  | `#07AEE9` |
| White                 | `#FFFFFF` |

The mapping of the three arcade game buttons is provided in Figure 5. The light-blue arcade game button on the left controls the lighting of the Smartie sorter, while the two white arcade game buttons are used to control the sorting process. When the left white arcade game button is pressed, then the sorting process starts, and when the right white arcade game button is pressed, the the sorting process stops.

## 3. Sorting locations

Once sorted, the Smarties and M&M's are transferred to the acrylic Sorted Smarties Collector component. The sorted positions of the Smarties and M&M's are presented in this section.

### 3.1. Smartie locations

The locations of the sorted Smarties in the Sorted Smarties Collector component are similar to their locations in the Smartie chocolates' colour scheme that was presented in Figure 6. The locations of the sorted Smarties in the Sorted Smarties Collector component are shown in Figure 8.

---------------------------- Sorted Smartie Positions ----------------------------

### 3.2. M&M locations

The locations of the sorted M&M's in the Sorted Smarties Collector component are similar to their locations in the official M&M colour scheme that was presented in Figure 7. The locations of the sorted M&M's in the Sorted Smarties Collector component are shown in Figure 9. Since there are only 6 M&M colours, the final two locations in the Sorted Smarties Collector component are not used when sorting M&M's.
