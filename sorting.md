# Sorting

## 1. Sorting Procedure

## 2. Operating Modes

There are three different operating properties that control the sorting behaviour of the Smartie Sorter 3000, namely:

- `SORTING_STATE`
- `CHOCOLATE_MODE`
- `SORTING_MODE`

Each of these properties have two different possible values that they can have at any given time. Section 2.1 provides more information about the different values that the operating properties can have while Section 2.2 provides the default values for each operating property.

### 2.1. Enumerated Values

The values of the three operating properties are tracked using enums. The Smartie Sorter 3000 must have a value for each property at any given time.

The `SORTING_STATE` property controls whether the Smartie Sorter 3000 is currently performing the sorting procedure that was outlined in Section 1. The two possible enumerated values are:

- SORTING
- NOT_SORTING

The `CHOCOLATE_MODE` property allows the Smartie Sorter 3000 to switch between sorting Smarties and sorting M&M's. The two possible enumerated values are:

- SMARTIES
- M_AND_M_S

The `SORTING_MODE` property allows the Smartie Sorter 3000 to switch between grouping the same-coloured Smarties and M&M's together (uncollated) and grouping the Smarties and M&M's in such a way that consecutive chocolates of the same colour end up in consecutive compartments (collated). The two possible enumerated values are:

- UNCOLLATED 
- COLLATED

### 2.2. Default Values

The default values of the three operating property are given by Table 1. These values have been hard-coded into the Arduino script and represent the values that the operating properties will have when powering on the Smartie Sorter 3000.

Table 1: The default values of the operating properties

| Property         | Default Value |
|------------------|---------------|
| `SORTING_STATE`  | NOT_SORTING   |
| `CHOCOLATE_MODE` | SMARTIES      |
| `SORTING_MODE`   | UNCOLLATED    |

## 3. Codes

The Smartie Sorter 3000 can operate in 4 different modes.

The different modes are selected by entering different codes using the arcade game buttons. Section 3.1 outlines the procedure for entering a code and Section 3.2 provides the codes for the different operating modes.

### 3.1. Procedure

The procedure to enter a code is as follows:

1. Press the blue arcade game button
2. Enter a combination of white button presses
3. Press the blue arcade game button again

The Smartie Sorter 3000 will enter the selected mode if a valid combination of white button presses was entered. The built-in LEDs will flash a certain number of times, corresponding to the mode number, to confirm that the code has been accepted.

### 3.2. Combinations

Table 2 provides the combinations for selecting the different operating modes.

For the combinations, `L` refers to a press of the left white arcade game button and `R` refers to a press of the right white arcade game button.

A numerical system is used to keep track of the button presses. Presses of the left white arcade game button (`L`) count +1 point while presses of the right white arcade game button (`R`) count +10 points. The selected operating mode is then entered based on the total points score.

Table 2: Combinations for entering the different operating modes

| Mode number | Combination     | Numeric Value | Description                       |
|:-----------:|-----------------|:-------------:|-----------------------------------|
|      -      | `L`             |       1       | Display the active chocolate mode |
|      -      | `R`             |       10      | Display the active sorting mode   |
|      1      | `L L R L L R L` |       25      | Enter the Smartie chocolate mode  |
|      2      | `L R L L R L R` |       34      | Enter the M&M chocolate mode      |
|      3      | `R L R R R L R` |       52      | Enter the uncollated sorting mode |
|      4      | `R R L R L L R` |       43      | Enter the collated sorting mode   |
