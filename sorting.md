## 1. Sorting Procedure

## 2. Codes

The Smartie Sorter 3000 can operate in 4 different modes.

The different modes are selected by entering different codes using the arcade game buttons. Section 2.1. outlines the procedure for entering a code and Section 2.2. provides the codes for the different operating modes.

### 2.1. Procedure

The procedure to enter a code is as follows:

1. Press the blue arcade game button
2. Enter a combination of white button presses
3. Press the blue arcade game button again

The Smartie Sorter 3000 will enter the selected mode if a valid combination of white button presses was entered. The built-in LEDs will flash a certain number of times, corresponding to the mode number, to confirm that the code has been accepted.

### 2.2. Combinations

Table 1 provides the combinations for selecting the different operating modes.

For the combinations, `L` refers to a press of the left white arcade game button and `R` refers to a press of the right white arcade game button.

A numerical system is used to keep track of the button presses. Presses of the left white arcade game button (`L`) count +1 point while presses of the right white arcade game button (`R`) count +10 points. The selected operating mode is then entered based on the total points score.
