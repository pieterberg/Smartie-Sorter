Arduino Smartie Sorter 3000 project for sorting Smarties and M&M's based on their colour using the TCS3200 colour sensor built into a mini Arcade Game enclosure.

The project was written using C++ and runs on an Arduino Nano microcontroller. The mini Arcade Game enclosure was designed using Fusion 360. The physical components were either laser-cut out of MDF and acrylic, or 3D printed using a PLA filament.
