The wooden components were laser cut from:

- 6 mm MDF

And the acrylic components were laser cut from either:

- 3 mm transparent acrylic
- or 6 mm transparent acrylic

The 3D printed components were printed using a Zortrax M300 3D printer. The components were printed using:

- White PLA filament

## 2. Resources

The documentation foler contains the following resources:

- Fusion 360 archive files (.f3d) of all the components
- DXF files (.dxf) to use for laser cutting the wooden components
